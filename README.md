I have used 5 different models 
1) for Speed i have used linear regresion model
2) for summary x and y and for motion categorical i have used conv3d
3) for element categorical i have used conv2d
4) and last for power i have used HSV color space for colour identification.  the model calculates the average hue value in the HSV space to determine the dominant color and then further classify in 30 classes using conv2d
